## Welcome!
My name is Zhe Xu, and I am a Walter Benjamin fellow and postdoctoral research associate in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html) and [Prof. Dr. Neil Thurman](https://neilthurman.com/). In 2024, I was awarded a [Walter Benjamin grant](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin) by the German Research Foundation (DFG). I am also a visiting scholar at the [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/).

I hold degrees in engineering and media studies, and earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from the [University of Cologne](https://www.uni-koeln.de/en/). While there, I served as a research and teaching assistant in media studies and received training in data science and machine learning from the [Center for Data and Simulation Science (CDS)](https://cds.uni-koeln.de/en/) and the [Department of Digital Humanities (IDH)](https://dh.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/). 

I work in crisis and political communication. I study how information and technology engage with global humanitarian crises, and how public decision-making is shaped as a result. Two directions that particularly excite me at this stage are:

- **Using and developing (un)supervised machine learning approaches on large-scale humanitarian news corpora:** emphasis framing and political functions across authoritarian and democratic media systems.
- **Cosmopolitan socialization in algorithmically and technologically infused platform societies:** leveraging experiments to investigate the (causal) impact mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) and virtual reality (VR) on public moral reasoning and humanitarian behavior.

Please feel free to contact me via email or through my [university profile](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/mitarbeiter/xu_zhe/index.html).
