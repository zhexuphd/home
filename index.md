## Welcome!

My name is Zhe Xu, and I am currently a [research associate](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/mitarbeiter/xu_zhe/index.html) and [Walter Benjamin postdoctoral fellow](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin) in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), working with [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html) and [Prof. Dr. Neil Thurman](https://neilthurman.com/). I was awarded a Walter Benjamin Programme by the German Research Foundation (DFG) for my new project on [humanitarian journalism in refugee crises](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/539233881?context=projekt&task=showDetail&id=539233881&). I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Cologne](https://portal.uni-koeln.de/es/uoc-home) in 2023.

I am continuously interested in the **effect of humanitarian news on policymaking and public engagement during crises**. More specifically, my research examines how global journalism engages with humanitarian emergencies and human vulnerabilities both politically and technologically, and whether such engagement can help mitigate public moral passivity and enhance the effectiveness of policy and legal interventions.

When I’m not immersed in academia, you’ll likely find me hiking, mountaineering, or bouldering with my wife and our little one in various parts of the world.
