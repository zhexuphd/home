## About Me

Welcome!

My name is Zhe Xu (you can just call me Zhe. Some of my colleagues find the pronunciation a bit challenging—my German colleagues tend to pronounce it like 'churr,' while my British colleagues go with 'zhur.'). I am currently a research associate and Walter Benjamin postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), where I affiliated with the [Journalism Studies research unit](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/lehrbereiche/hanitzsch/hanitzsch_profil/index.html) lead by [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html). I am also a PI in the German Research Foundation project [Global Disparities in Journalistic Practices in Mediating Migration Crises (2024-2026)](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/539233881?context=projekt&task=showDetail&id=539233881&). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of <b>crisis communication</b> and <b>computational communication</b>. Using methodologies from social science, computational science (NLP/ML), and network science, my research explores (1) <b>journalistic practices</b> during global crises, with a particular focus on institutional roles and the integration of AI, algorithmic, and immersive computing technologies in newsrooms; and (2) the <b>media effects</b> on audiences, addressing issues such as public compassion fatigue and the socio-psychological mechanisms underlying moral denial. These works together interrogate the (de)politicization, platformization, datafication, and algorithmization involved in the <b>mediation of global humanitarian crises</b>. My leading authored and/or co-first authored work has been featured in peer-reviewed journals and books, including [<i>Int J Commun</i>](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/19850), [<i>Int Commun Gaz</i>](https://doi.org/10.1177/17480485231216583), [<i>Media Cult Soc</i>](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01634437231155339), [<i>Journalism</i>](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14648849231206924), and in the volume [<i>(De)constructing Societal Threats During Times of Deep Mediatization</i>](https://www.routledge.com/Deconstructing-Societal-Threats-During-Times-of-Deep-Mediatization/Reilly-Salojarvi/p/book/9781032566825?srsltid=AfmBOopxXUTQTbEmhs3a9IGUdfOHPwEkUVSkvYxx-3UR4WaoGStidOEb). 

I have undergone extensive training in computational and data science at the [University of Cologne's CA III Quantitative Modeling of Complex Systems](http://ml-school.uni-koeln.de/) and the [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+C-FX-06+V2). In addition, I actively contribute as a reviewer for several academic journals (<i>Int J Commun</i>, <i>Journal Pract</i>), major international conferences such as [ECREA](https://ecrea.eu/), and the [Czech Science Foundation](https://gacr.cz/en/). Before relocating to Munich, I completed my Ph.D. at the [University of Cologne](https://portal.uni-koeln.de/es/uoc-home) in Germany and my master’s degree at the [University of East Anglia](https://www.uea.ac.uk/) in the UK

When I’m not immersed in academia, you’ll likely find me hiking, mountaineering, or bouldering with my wife and our little one. I’ve ticked off treks in both the Annapurnas and the Himalayas, and Patagonia is my absolute favourite for outdoor kit.

## Ongoing DFG Project

**Global Disparities in Journalistic Practices in Mediating Migration Crises (2024-2026)**
Employing computational methods (including SML, NLP, and network science), this project conducts an extensive, cross-national, and longitudinal analysis of news data to examine how media across diverse countries use framing to portray the global migration crisis and define their journalistic roles. By providing a comprehensive overview of journalistic practices surrounding migration crises, this study seeks to expand the epistemological, ontological, and empirical boundaries of the field of humanitarian journalism in a world characterized by crises driven by globalization and mediatization.

## Papers in Progress

"The Role Performance of Global Journalism in Humanitarian Crises" 

"Mapping Online Climate Change Controversies in Authoritarian Regimes"
