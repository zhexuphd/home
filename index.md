## Welcome!
My name is Zhe Xu, and I am a Walter Benjamin fellow and postdoctoral research associate in political, crisis, and computational communication in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html) and [Prof. Dr. Neil Thurman](https://neilthurman.com/). 

I hold degrees in engineering and media studies and earned my Ph.D. from the [University of Cologne](https://www.uni-koeln.de/en/) in 2023. While there, I served as a research and teaching assistant in media studies and received training in data science and machine learning from the [Center for Data and Simulation Science (CDS)](https://cds.uni-koeln.de/en/) and the [Department of Digital Humanities (IDH)](https://dh.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/). In 2024, I was awarded a [Walter Benjamin grant](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin) by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

I use social and data science methods on diverse datasets of news corpora and human behavior to examine how media and technology engage with global humanitarian crises, and how policymaking, public decision-making, and cosmopolitan socialization are shaped as a result. In addition, I actively engage in other projects led by computer scientists in human-computer interaction (HCI) and by neuroscientists, to explore better ways of communicating humanitarian emergencies and human vulnerability.

Please feel free to contact me via email or through my [university profile](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/mitarbeiter/xu_zhe/index.html).
