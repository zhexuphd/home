## Welcome!
My name is Zhe Xu, and I am a Walter Benjamin fellow and postdoctoral research associate in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html) and [Prof. Dr. Neil Thurman](https://neilthurman.com/). 

I hold degrees in engineering and media studies, and earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from the [University of Cologne](https://www.uni-koeln.de/en/). While there, I served as a research and teaching assistant in media studies and received training in data science and machine learning from the [Center for Data and Simulation Science (CDS)](https://cds.uni-koeln.de/en/) and the [Department of Digital Humanities (IDH)](https://dh.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/). 

I work in crisis communication, computational social science, media effects, and natural language processing. I study how information and technology engage with global humanitarian crises, and how public decision-making is shaped as a result. Two directions that particularly excite me at this stage are:

- **Machine learning analysis of large-scale humanitarian news:** mapping emphasis framing and political functions. (Current DFG-funded [project](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/539233881?language=en) as Principal Investigator, €221,430)
- **Cosmopolitan socialization in algorithmically and technologically mediated platform societies:** experiments and causal inference on the effects of LLMs and VR in public moral reasoning and humanitarian behavior.

Please feel free to contact me via email or through my [university profile](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/mitarbeiter/xu_zhe/index.html).
