## Welcome!

My name is Zhe Xu, and I'm a political communication scientist in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html) and [Prof. Dr. Neil Thurman](https://neilthurman.com/). In 2024, I was awarded a [Walter Benjamin grant](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin) (â‚¬22,1430) by the German Research Foundation (DFG). I earned my Ph.D. from the [University of Cologne](https://www.uni-koeln.de/en/) in 2023. While there, I served as a research and teaching assistant in media studies and received training in data science and machine learning from the Center for Data and Simulation Science (CDS).

My current research focuses on two main areas. First, I use data science and and machine learning approaches to comparatively explore how news media worldwide engage with global humanitarian crises, specifically examining their political journalistic roles and news framing. Second, I use experimental, survey, and interview data from journalists and the public in authoritarian contexts to investigate how mediated humanitarian crises shape humanitarian policymaking and public moral action.
