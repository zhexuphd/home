## Welcome!

My name is Zhe Xu, and I am currently a [research associate](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/mitarbeiter/xu_zhe/index.html) and [Walter Benjamin postdoctoral fellow](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin) in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), working with [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html) and [Prof. Dr. Neil Thurman](https://neilthurman.com/). I was awarded a Walter Benjamin grant by the German Research Foundation (DFG). I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Cologne](https://portal.uni-koeln.de/es/uoc-home) in 2023.

My research focuses on political and crisis communication. I use experimental, computational, and ethnographic methods with diverse datasets to examine how media and humanitarian actors in both authoritarian and democratic contexts engage with global crises and human vulnerabilities, both politically and technologically, and whether such engagement can reduce public moral passivity and enhance the effectiveness of policy and legal interventions.

When I’m not immersed in academia, you’ll likely find me hiking, mountaineering, or bouldering with my wife and our little one in various parts of the world.
