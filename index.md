## Welcome!
My name is Zhe Xu, and I am a Walter Benjamin fellow and postdoctoral research associate in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html) and [Prof. Dr. Neil Thurman](https://neilthurman.com/). In 2024, I was awarded a [Walter Benjamin grant](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin) by the German Research Foundation (DFG). I am also a visiting scholar at the [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/).

I hold degrees in engineering and media studies, and earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from the [University of Cologne](https://www.uni-koeln.de/en/). While there, I served as a research and teaching assistant in media studies and received training in data science and machine learning from the [Center for Data and Simulation Science (CDS)](https://cds.uni-koeln.de/en/) and the [Department of Digital Humanities (IDH)](https://dh.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/). 

I work in crisis communication. I use experimental and computational methods with news and behavioral data to study how information and technology engage with global humanitarian crises, and how public decision-making is shaped as a result.

Here are some directions that I continue to be excited about:

- BA Communication Science, LMU Munich, 2025-2026
- MA Journalism, Media & Globalisation, LMU Munich, 2024-2025
- MA Chinese Studies & Media Studies, University of Cologne, 2022-2023

Please feel free to contact me via email or through my [university profile](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/mitarbeiter/xu_zhe/index.html).
