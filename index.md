## Welcome!

My name is Zhe Xu, and I am currently a [postdoctoral research associate](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/mitarbeiter/xu_zhe/index.html) in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), working with [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html) and [Prof. Dr. Neil Thurman](https://neilthurman.com/). I was awarded a [Walter Benjamin grant](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin) by the German Research Foundation (DFG). I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Cologne](https://portal.uni-koeln.de/es/uoc-home) in 2023.

My research focuses on political and crisis communication. I use experimental, computational, and ethnographic methods with diverse datasets to examine how media and humanitarian actors mediate global crises and human vulnerabilities, both politically and technologically, and how these mediations influence public engagement, policymaking, and legal interventions.

When I’m not immersed in academia, you’ll likely find me hiking, mountaineering, or bouldering with my wife and our little one in various parts of the world.
