## Welcome!

My name is Zhe Xu, and I am currently a [research associate](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/mitarbeiter/xu_zhe/index.html) and Walter Benjamin postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), affiliated with [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html)'s team and [Prof. Dr. Neil Thurman](https://neilthurman.com/)'s team (by courtesy). I am also a PI in the German Research Foundation project [Global Humanitarian Journalism (2024-2026)](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/539233881?context=projekt&task=showDetail&id=539233881&). I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Cologne](https://portal.uni-koeln.de/es/uoc-home) in 2023.

Using methods from social, computational, and network sciences, my research primarily investigates: (1) **journalistic practices** during global crises such as refugee displacement, climate change, and war, with a focus on institutional roles, news framing, and the use of AI, algorithmic, and immersive technologies; and (2) their **effects on the public**, including compassion fatigue and socio-psychological mechanisms of moral passivity. Together, these efforts aim to critically analyze the processes of **(de)politicization, platformization, and algorithmization** in the **mediation of global humanitarian crises**. Please feel free to check the full list of my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=lxUyedYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

During my bachelor's in engineering science, I quickly realized engineering wasn’t my path, despite my love for math. Drawn by journalism and social justice, I shifted to the social sciences in the UK, earning a master’s degree in media studies. Now, the rise of data science and modeling in communication has reignited my passion for math. To deepen my expertise, I have undergone extensive training in computational and data science at the [University of Cologne's CA III Quantitative Modeling of Complex Systems](http://ml-school.uni-koeln.de/) and the [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+C-FX-06+V2). 

When I’m not immersed in academia, you’ll likely find me hiking, mountaineering, or bouldering with my wife and our little one in various parts of the world.

## Areas of Specialization

- **Crisis and Conflict Communication:** mediation of humanitarianism, politics of humanitarian journalism, moral passivity
- **Computational and Immersive Journalism:** immersive computing in newsrooms, algorithmic accountability and transparency, journalistic data mining, technocolonialism in journalism, plausibility illusion in VR storytelling
