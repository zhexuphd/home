## Welcome!

My name is Zhe Xu, and I am currently a [research associate](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/mitarbeiter/xu_zhe/index.html) and [Walter Benjamin postdoctoral fellow](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/walter-benjamin) in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), affiliated with [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html)'s [research unit](https://www.en.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/research/chairs/hanitzsch/index.html) and [Prof. Dr. Neil Thurman](https://neilthurman.com/)'s [research unit](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/lehrbereiche/thurman/index.html) (by courtesy). I am also a PI in the German Research Foundation project [Humanitarian Journalism in Global Crises](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/539233881?context=projekt&task=showDetail&id=539233881&). I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Cologne](https://portal.uni-koeln.de/es/uoc-home) in 2023.

I am continuously interested in **how humanitarian news affects policymaking and public engagement during crises**. 

When I’m not immersed in academia, you’ll likely find me hiking, mountaineering, or bouldering with my wife and our little one in various parts of the world.
